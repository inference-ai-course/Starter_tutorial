## Common Pitfalls & Tips

### Shell and Command Line
- ⚠️ **`rm -rf` is destructive**: Always double-check before removing files
- 💡 Use tab completion to avoid typos
- 💡 Check command syntax with `man <command>` or `<command> --help`

### Git
- ⚠️ **Never commit secrets**: Use `.gitignore` for credentials and API keys
- 💡 Write descriptive commit messages
- 💡 Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts

### SSH
- ⚠️ **Protect private keys**: Use passphrases and appropriate permissions (600)
- 💡 Use SSH config file for convenience
- 💡 Test connections with `ssh -vvv` for debugging

### Conda
- ⚠️ **Avoid installing in base**: Create separate environments for projects
- 💡 Export environments for reproducibility
- 💡 Use conda for large packages, pip for pure Python packages

### Jupyter
- ⚠️ **Port conflicts**: Check for existing Jupyter instances
- 💡 Register kernels for different environments
- 💡 Use meaningful notebook names
