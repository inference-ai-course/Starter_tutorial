### 3. File Organization
- **Backed up** misplaced Practice.md (renamed to _Practice_old.md.backup)
- **Cleaned up** empty placeholder files
- **Organized** all practice materials into focused notebooks

## Technology Requirements Met

✅ **Python 3.10+**: Specified in all relevant sections and notebooks
✅ **PyTorch 2.6.0+**: Included in Conda practice notebook with installation instructions
✅ **CUDA 12.4+**: Specified with PyTorch installation for GPU support
✅ **All tools documented**: Git, SSH, Conda, VS Code, Jupyter

## Structure Consistency

Chapter 1 now follows the same pattern as Chapters 2-4:
- Overview section with duration
- Clear learning objectives
- Structured chapter organization
- Prerequisites clearly stated
- Technology requirements section
- Quick start guides
- Assessment checkpoints
- Common pitfalls & tips
- Interactive practice notebooks
- References to other resources

## Files in Chapter 1

### Documentation (Markdown)
- `Chapter1.md` - Main chapter overview and navigation (7.9 KB)
- `Git.md` - Git concepts and workflows (3.8 KB)
- `SSH.md` - SSH setup and configuration (5.5 KB)
- `Conda.md` - Conda environment management (3.3 KB)
- `Jupyter.md` - Jupyter notebook concepts (4.3 KB)

### Practice Notebooks (Jupyter)
- `git_practice.ipynb` - Git hands-on exercises (48 cells, 16 KB) ✅ VERIFIED
- `conda_practice.ipynb` - Conda practice lab (49 cells, 16 KB) ✅ VERIFIED  
- `ssh_setup_lab.ipynb` - SSH setup exercises (28 cells, 17 KB) ✅ VERIFIED
- `jupyter_basics_lab.ipynb` - Jupyter basics practice (45 cells, 19 KB) ✅ VERIFIED

**All notebooks are:**
- ✅ Valid JSON format
- ✅ Compatible with Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- ✅ Include proper metadata and kernelspec
- ✅ Ready to run and execute
- ✅ Contain comprehensive exercises with code examples

### Backup
- `_Practice_old.md.backup` - Original Practice.md (contains Chapter 2 content)

## Learning Path

Students can now:
1. Read the overview in Chapter1.md
2. Study individual topics (Git, SSH, Conda, Jupyter)
3. Practice with focused notebooks for each topic
4. Complete exercises at their own pace
5. Verify learning with assessment checkpoints

## Next Steps for Users

1. Start with Chapter1.md overview
2. Choose learning path based on experience level
3. Study relevant markdown documentation
4. Complete corresponding practice notebooks
5. Verify skills with assessment checkpoints
6. Move on to Chapter 2

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Modular**: Each topic has its own practice notebook
✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add more exercises or topics
✅ **Interactive**: Hands-on learning with immediate feedback
✅ **Comprehensive**: Covers all essential development tools
✅ **Consistent**: Matches structure of other chapters
✅ **Technology Current**: Specifies modern versions (Python 3.10+, PyTorch 2.6.0+, CUDA 12.4+)
✅ **Practical**: Real-world scenarios and examples
✅ **Self-paced**: Students can focus on areas they need
