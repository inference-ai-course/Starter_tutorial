# Chapter 3: AI Engineering Fundamentals - Function Calling, Prompt Engineering, and Model Interfaces

## Overview

This chapter covers essential AI engineering concepts for working with modern language models and AI systems. You'll learn how to create reliable, structured interactions with AI models through function calling, master prompt engineering techniques, and understand different model interfaces and deployment options.

## Learning Path

### Part 1: Function Calling and Structured Outputs
Learn to create reliable, machine-readable responses from AI models using JSON schemas, function definitions, and structured output constraints. Master the tool calling paradigm that enables AI models to interact with external systems and APIs.

**Key Concepts:**
- Function/tool calling with JSON Schema
- Structured output generation
- Cross-provider compatibility
- Reliability and validation techniques

### Part 2: Prompt Engineering and Evaluation
Develop expertise in crafting effective prompts that produce consistent, high-quality outputs. Learn evaluation frameworks and parameter tuning strategies to optimize model performance.

**Key Concepts:**
- System prompts and role design
- Few-shot learning and reasoning
- Guardrails against hallucinations
- Parameter tuning (temperature, top_p)
- Evaluation frameworks

### Part 3: Model Interfaces and Deployment
Explore different ways to interact with AI models, from cloud APIs to local inference endpoints. Understand the trade-offs between various deployment options and learn to build robust AI applications.

**Key Concepts:**
- OpenAI-compatible interfaces
- HuggingFace Inference Providers
- Local inference with Ollama and vLLM
- Performance optimization
- Authentication and security

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with JSON and APIs
- Completion of Chapter 2: Python and Environment Management

## Technology Requirements

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **PyTorch**: 2.6.0 or higher
- **CUDA**: 12.4 or higher (for GPU acceleration)
- **Key Libraries**: transformers, huggingface_hub, openai, requests

## Chapter Structure

Each part includes:
- **Conceptual explanations** with real-world examples
- **Hands-on coding exercises** in Jupyter notebooks
- **Practical labs** with step-by-step implementation
- **Assessment checkpoints** to verify understanding
- **Common pitfalls and solutions**

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Design and implement** function calling systems with proper JSON schema validation
2. **Create reliable prompts** that produce consistent, structured outputs
3. **Evaluate and optimize** model performance across different parameters and providers
4. **Deploy and manage** AI models using various interfaces and platforms
5. **Build production-ready** AI applications with proper error handling and monitoring

## Getting Started

Choose your learning path based on your experience level:

- **Beginners**: Start with Part 1 and progress sequentially
- **Experienced developers**: Focus on specific sections based on your needs
- **Hands-on learners**: Jump directly to the practical exercises and labs

Each section builds upon previous concepts, but can also be studied independently for specific skills.
