    "**Purpose**: Learn to monitor GPU resources programmatically using PyTorch's CUDA API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why GPU Monitoring Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "GPUs are the most expensive resource in deep learning:\n",
    "- A single NVIDIA A100 GPU costs $10,000-15,000\n",
    "- Cloud GPU instances: $1-10+ per hour\n",
    "- Training large models can take weeks of GPU time\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring helps you:\n",
    "- **Detect underutilization**: Are you using 10% of GPU when you could use 80%?\n",
    "- **Prevent OOM errors**: Know when you're approaching memory limits\n",
    "- **Optimize batch sizes**: Find the sweet spot between speed and memory\n",
    "- **Debug memory leaks**: Track memory growth over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Device Name**: Which GPU model you're using (e.g., RTX 3090, A100)\n",
    "2. **Total Memory**: Maximum GPU memory available (e.g., 24GB, 40GB)\n",
    "3. **Allocated Memory**: Memory currently in use by PyTorch tensors\n",
    "4. **Reserved Memory**: Memory reserved by PyTorch's caching allocator\n",
    "5. **Free Memory**: Available memory for new allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Allocated vs Reserved**: PyTorch reserves memory in chunks for efficiency. Allocated is what's actually used.\n",
    "- **Memory Fragmentation**: Even with free memory, large allocations might fail due to fragmentation.\n",
    "- **Multiple GPUs**: If you have multiple GPUs, monitor each one separately.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Learn to identify and fix the most common memory leak in PyTorch code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Hidden Computation Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch uses **automatic differentiation** (autograd) which builds a computation graph:\n",
    "- Every tensor operation is recorded\n",
    "- Gradients are computed by traversing this graph backward\n",
    "- The graph is stored in memory until explicitly freed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Mistake**: Storing tensors that still have computation graphs attached:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "losses = []\n",
    "for epoch in range(100):\n",
    "    loss = model(data).sum()\n",
    "    losses.append(loss)  # LEAK\\! Stores entire graph\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Causes Memory Leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "When you append a tensor with `requires_grad=True` to a list:\n",
    "1. The tensor keeps a reference to the computation graph\n",
    "2. The graph includes all intermediate tensors and operations\n",
    "3. These never get garbage collected\n",
    "4. Memory usage grows linearly with training steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Impact**: A model training for 10,000 steps might leak 10GB+ of memory\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Detach from Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `.item()` to extract the scalar value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "losses.append(loss.item())  # FIX\\! Only stores the number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives:\n",
    "- `loss.detach()` - detaches but keeps as tensor\n",
    "- `loss.cpu().numpy()` - converts to numpy array\n",
    "- Don't store it at all if not needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `train_with_leak()` and observe memory growth\n",
    "2. Identify the line causing the leak\n",
    "3. Fix it in `train_fixed()`\n",
    "4. Verify memory stays constant\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to Observe**:\n",
    "- Memory should grow steadily in the leaky version\n",
    "- Memory should stabilize in the fixed version\n",

    "Attempt 1: Wait 1 second\n",
    "Attempt 2: Wait 2 seconds\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Use PyTorch Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Performance Mystery\n",
    "\n",
    "Your training is slow. But why?\n",
    "- Is it the model forward pass?\n",
    "- Is it the backward pass (gradients)?\n",
    "- Is it the optimizer step?\n",
    "- Is it data transfer between CPU and GPU?\n",
    "- Is it a specific layer (attention, convolution)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guessing is wasteful**. Profiling gives you data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What PyTorch Profiler Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU Time**:\n",
    "- Python overhead\n",
    "- Data preprocessing\n",
    "- Kernel launches\n",
    "- Memory allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "**CUDA Time** (GPU):\n",
    "- Actual GPU kernel execution\n",
    "- Memory transfers (CPU ↔ GPU)\n",
    "- Synchronization overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory**:\n",
    "- Allocations and deallocations\n",
    "- Peak memory usage\n",
    "- Memory bandwidth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Profiler Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The profiler shows a table like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name                    CPU Time    CUDA Time    Calls\n",
    "aten::linear            10.5ms      50.2ms       100\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to interpret**:\n",
    "- **High CPU time**: Python overhead, data loading\n",
    "- **High CUDA time**: GPU computation bottleneck\n",
    "- **Many calls**: Might benefit from fusion\n",
    "- **CPU > CUDA**: GPU is idle, CPU is bottleneck\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Bottlenecks and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Loading Bottleneck**\n",
    "- Symptom: GPU utilization < 50%, high CPU time\n",
    "- Solution: More DataLoader workers, prefetch, faster disk\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Small Batch Size**\n",
    "- Symptom: Low GPU utilization, many kernel launches\n",
    "- Solution: Increase batch size, gradient accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. CPU-GPU Transfers**\n",
    "- Symptom: High time in memory copy operations\n",
    "- Solution: Pin memory, avoid unnecessary .cpu()/.cuda() calls\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Slow Operations**\n",
    "- Symptom: One operation dominates CUDA time\n",
    "- Solution: Optimize that operation, use fused kernels, consider alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profiling Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Warm up**: Run a few iterations before profiling (CUDA initialization overhead)\n",
    "2. **Profile production workload**: Use real batch sizes and model architecture\n",
    "3. **Focus on hot spots**: Optimize the top 3-5 operations first (80/20 rule)\n",
    "4. **Profile iteratively**: Profile → Optimize → Profile again\n",

    "2. Runs 10 forward and backward passes\n",

    "4. Displays the top 10 operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to look for**:\n",
    "- Which operations take the most time?\n",
    "- Is time spent on forward pass or backward pass?\n",
    "- Are there unexpected slow operations?\n",
    "\n",

    "- Export trace to Chrome: `prof.export_chrome_trace('trace.json')`\n",
    "- View in chrome://tracing for visual timeline\n",
    "- Compare with different batch sizes\n",
