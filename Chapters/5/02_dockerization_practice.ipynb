    "**Prerequisites**: Docker installed, Python 3.10+, PyTorch 2.6.0+, CUDA 12.4+\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Dockerfiles**: Create container images for AI/ML projects from scratch\n",
    "2. **GPU Support**: Configure CUDA and NVIDIA runtime for deep learning\n",
    "3. **Multi-Service Apps**: Orchestrate training, inference, and development environments\n",
    "4. **Optimization**: Reduce image sizes with multi-stage builds\n",
    "5. **Best Practices**: Security, caching, and production-ready configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Docker for AI/ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Dependency Hell Problem**:\n",
    "- Different projects need different Python versions\n",
    "- PyTorch 1.x vs 2.x incompatibilities\n",
    "- CUDA version mismatches\n",
    "- System library conflicts\n",
    "- \"Works on my machine\" syndrome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker Solves This**:\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Same environment everywhere (dev, staging, prod)\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Each project has its own dependencies\n",
    "- **Portability**: Build once, run anywhere (laptop, cloud, HPC)\n",
    "- **Version Control**: Dockerfile tracks environment changes with code\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to deploy thousands of containers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Impact**:\n",
    "- Companies save weeks of environment setup time\n",
    "- Research reproducibility improves dramatically\n",
    "- CI/CD pipelines become reliable\n",

    "## Exercise 1: Create a Basic Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Learn the fundamental building blocks of Dockerfiles for PyTorch applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Dockerfiles\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dockerfile is a **recipe** for building a Docker image:\n",
    "- Written as a series of instructions (commands)\n",
    "- Each instruction creates a new layer\n",
    "- Layers are cached for faster rebuilds\n",
    "- Final image is a stack of all layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a script that:\n",
    "1. Starts with a base operating system\n",
    "2. Installs software\n",
    "3. Copies your code\n",
    "4. Configures how to run it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Dockerfile Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**FROM**: Choose base image\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-slim  # Official Python image, minimal size\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Always the first instruction\n",
    "- Use official images when possible (security, maintenance)\n",
    "- `-slim` variant: Smaller size, fewer packages\n",
    "- `-alpine`: Even smaller, but compatibility issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**WORKDIR**: Set working directory\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "WORKDIR /app  # All subsequent commands run here\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Like `cd /app` but also creates directory\n",
    "- Keeps image organized\n",
    "- Relative paths in COPY/ADD are relative to WORKDIR\n",
    "\n",
    "**RUN**: Execute commands during build\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "RUN pip install torch  # Runs at build time\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Installs packages, downloads files, compiles code\n",
    "- Each RUN creates a new layer (affects image size)\n",
    "- Combine multiple commands with && to reduce layers\n",
    "\n",
    "**COPY**: Copy files from host to image\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "COPY app.py .  # Copies app.py to /app/app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Copies from build context (usually current directory)\n",
    "- Use .dockerignore to exclude files\n",
    "- Copying source code last improves cache efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**CMD**: Default command when container starts\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]  # Runs when container starts\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Only one CMD per Dockerfile (last one wins)\n",
    "- Can be overridden: `docker run myimage python other.py`\n",
    "- Use JSON array format for better signal handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use python:3.10-slim?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Image | Size | Use Case |\n",
    "|-------|------|----------|\n",
    "| python:3.10 | ~900MB | Full development, all tools |\n",
    "| python:3.10-slim | ~120MB | Production, minimal overhead |\n",
    "| python:3.10-alpine | ~50MB | Ultra-minimal, may have compatibility issues |\n",
    "\n",
    "**For ML**: slim is the sweet spot - small but compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer Caching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker caches layers. Order matters for efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad (slow rebuilds)**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "COPY . .              # Changes frequently\n",
    "RUN pip install torch # Runs every code change\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good (fast rebuilds)**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "RUN pip install torch # Cached unless dependencies change\n",
    "COPY . .              # Only this layer rebuilds on code changes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practice**: Copy requirements.txt first, install, then copy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Dockerfile that:\n",
    "1. Uses `python:3.10-slim` as base (lightweight)\n",
    "2. Sets `/app` as working directory (organization)\n",

    "## Exercise 2: Create a Sample Application\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Build a diagnostic application to verify Docker environment setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Create a Test Application?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying production models, verify:\n",
    "- Python version is correct\n",
    "- PyTorch installed successfully\n",
    "- CUDA is accessible (for GPU containers)\n",
    "- Basic tensor operations work\n",
    "\n",
    "**In production**: Similar health check scripts validate deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Application Does\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Environment Information**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"Python: {sys.version}\")\n",
    "print(f\"PyTorch: {torch.__version__}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Confirms correct versions are installed\n",
    "- Useful for debugging version mismatches\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. CUDA Detection**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "torch.cuda.is_available()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Returns True if GPU is accessible\n",
    "- False might mean: no GPU, wrong driver, wrong PyTorch build\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. GPU Information** (if available):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Shows GPU model (e.g., \"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\")\n",
    "- Helps verify correct GPU is being used\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Computation Test**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda()\n",
    "y = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda()\n",
    "z = torch.matmul(x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Matrix multiplication is a common ML operation\n",
    "- Tests both memory allocation and computation\n",
    "- Failure here means something is seriously wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "### CPU vs GPU Code Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the conditional logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if torch.cuda.is_available():\n",
    "    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda()  # GPU\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000)  # CPU\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**:\n",
    "- CPU-only containers (for testing/development)\n",
    "- GPU containers (for training/inference)\n",
    "- Same code works in both environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container Health Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern extends to production:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dockerfile health check**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \\\n",
    "  CMD python health_check.py || exit 1\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Check PyTorch CUDA version matches system CUDA\n",
    "4. Use `--gpus all` flag when running container\n",
    "\n",
    "**If computation fails**:\n",
    "1. Out of memory: Reduce matrix size\n",

    "### The Docker Build Process\n",
    "\n",

    "**Breaking it down**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`docker build`**: The build command\n",
    "\n",
    "**`-t pytorch-basic`**: Tag (name) the image\n",
    "- Format: `name:tag` (e.g., `pytorch-basic:v1.0`)\n",
    "- No tag specified = `latest` by default\n",
    "- Use descriptive names: `my-model-trainer`, `api-server`\n",
    "\n",
    "**`-f Dockerfile.basic`**: Specify which Dockerfile\n",
    "- Default: looks for file named `Dockerfile`\n",
    "- Use -f when you have multiple Dockerfiles\n",
    "- Examples: Dockerfile.dev, Dockerfile.prod, Dockerfile.gpu\n",
    "\n",
    "**`.`**: Build context (current directory)\n",
    "- Docker sends all files in this directory to build daemon\n",
    "- COPY commands copy from this context\n",
    "- Use .dockerignore to exclude large/unnecessary files\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Configure Docker containers for GPU-accelerated deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why GPU Containers Are Different\n",
    "\n",
    "GPUs require special setup:\n",
    "- **CUDA runtime** libraries (not just drivers)\n",
    "- **cuDNN** for optimized neural network operations\n",
    "- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** on host system\n",
    "- **Matching versions** (CUDA, PyTorch, drivers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The challenge**: Getting all versions aligned correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites for GPU Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "**On the host system (your machine)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NVIDIA GPU**: Obviously\\!\n",
    "2. **NVIDIA Driver**: Version 535+ for CUDA 12.x\n",
    "   - Check: `nvidia-smi`\n",
    "3. **nvidia-docker2**: Docker GPU support\n",
    "   - Install: See 02_dockerization.md\n",
    "4. **Docker configured**: Runtime set to nvidia\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issue**: CPU Dockerfile works but GPU version fails due to missing prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NVIDIA CUDA Base Images\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA provides official images with CUDA pre-installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image options**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04     # Minimal CUDA\n",
    "nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04  # + libraries\n",
    "nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-devel-ubuntu22.04    # + dev tools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which to use**:\n",
    "- **base**: Just CUDA, smallest\n",
    "- **runtime**: For inference, includes cuDNN ← **Use this**\n",
    "- **devel**: For compiling CUDA code, largest\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size comparison**:\n",
    "- base: ~200MB\n",
    "- runtime: ~1.5GB\n",
    "- devel: ~3GB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python on CUDA Images\n",

    "# This is Ubuntu, not Python\\!\n",
    "FROM nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04\n",
    "\n",
    "# Must install Python ourselves\n",
    "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n",
    "    python3.10 \\\n",
    "    python3-pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not FROM python:3.10 with CUDA**?\n",
    "- Python images don't include CUDA\n",
    "- Installing CUDA manually is complex and error-prone\n",
    "- NVIDIA images are tested and optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch CUDA Version Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical**: PyTorch CUDA version must match container CUDA version\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our setup**:\n",
    "- Container: CUDA 12.4\n",
    "- PyTorch: Must use cu124 build\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "RUN pip install torch>=2.6.0 \\\n",
    "    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index URLs**:\n",
    "- cu124: CUDA 12.4\n",
    "- cu121: CUDA 12.1\n",
    "- cu118: CUDA 11.8\n",
    "- cpu: CPU-only version\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong version = Runtime errors or no GPU detected\\!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Python as Default\n",
    "\n",
    "Ubuntu 22.04 has `python3` but not `python`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "RUN update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.10 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**:\n",
    "- Makes `python` command work (not just `python3`)\n",
    "- Avoids scripts failing with \"python: command not found\"\n",
    "- Standard practice in containerized environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running GPU Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Must use `--gpus` flag**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --gpus all --rm pytorch-gpu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPU access options**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "--gpus all              # All GPUs\n",
    "--gpus '\"device=0\"'     # GPU 0 only\n",
    "--gpus '\"device=0,1\"'   # GPU 0 and 1\n",
    "--gpus 2                # Any 2 GPUs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without --gpus**: Container runs but `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns False\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting GPU Access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checklist**:\n",
    "1. ✅ Host GPU works: `nvidia-smi`\n",
    "2. ✅ nvidia-docker installed: `docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base nvidia-smi`\n",
    "3. ✅ Used `--gpus all` flag when running\n",
    "4. ✅ CUDA versions match (container CUDA = PyTorch CUDA)\n",
    "5. ✅ PyTorch installed from correct index-url\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test GPU access in container**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --gpus all --rm pytorch-gpu nvidia-smi\n",
    "```\n",
    "Should show GPU info, not \"command not found\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU Container Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Pin CUDA version**:\n",
    "- Use specific tag: `12.4.0-runtime` not `latest`\n",
    "- Ensures reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Match everything**:\n",
    "- Host CUDA/driver version\n",
    "- Container CUDA version\n",
    "- PyTorch CUDA build version\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Set shared memory size**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --gpus all --shm-size=8g pytorch-gpu\n",
    "```\n",
    "- PyTorch DataLoader needs shared memory\n",
    "- Default 64MB often too small\n",
    "- Symptoms: DataLoader hangs or crashes\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Monitor GPU in container**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker exec -it container_name nvidia-smi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a GPU-enabled Dockerfile that:\n",
    "1. Uses NVIDIA CUDA 12.4 runtime base\n",
    "2. Installs Python 3.10 and pip\n",
    "3. Makes python the default command\n",
    "4. Installs PyTorch with matching CUDA version\n",
    "5. Copies and runs app.py\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Dramatically reduce Docker image sizes by separating build and runtime environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Image Size Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical ML image build**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10\n",
    "RUN pip install torch transformers numpy pandas scikit-learn\n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: 5-10GB image containing:\n",
    "- Build tools (gcc, make, pip)\n",
    "- Package manager caches\n",
    "- Source files from installations\n",
    "- Intermediate build artifacts\n",
    "- Everything, even if only needed during installation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems**:\n",
    "- Slow to download (minutes on slow connections)\n",
    "- Expensive to store (cloud storage costs)\n",
    "- More attack surface (extra software = more vulnerabilities)\n",
    "- Slower to start (container needs to extract GBs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Multi-Stage Builds?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**: Use multiple FROM statements in one Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1 (builder)**: Full environment with build tools\n",
    "- Install packages\n",
    "- Compile code\n",
    "- Download dependencies\n",
    "- All the heavy lifting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2 (runtime)**: Minimal environment\n",
    "- Copy only installed packages from Stage 1\n",
    "- No build tools\n",
    "- No caches\n",
    "- Just what's needed to run\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magic**: Stage 1 artifacts are discarded, only Stage 2 becomes the final image\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Size Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single-stage**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10\n",
    "RUN pip install torch transformers\n",
    "```\n",
    "Size: ~5-7GB\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-stage**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10 as builder\n",
    "RUN pip install --user torch transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-slim\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local\n",
    "```\n",
    "Size: ~2-3GB (40-60% smaller\\!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Multi-Stage Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Builder**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10 as builder  # Named 'builder'\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY requirements.txt .\n",
    "RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points**:\n",
    "- `as builder`: Names this stage\n",
    "- `--user`: Installs to /root/.local instead of system-wide\n",
    "- `--no-cache-dir`: Don't save pip cache (saves ~100-500MB)\n",
    "- Full `python:3.10` image (has compilers, headers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2: Runtime**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-slim  # Fresh, minimal base\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local  # Magic line\\!\n",
    "ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH\n",
    "COPY app.py .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points**:\n",
    "- New FROM = new base, previous stage discarded\n",
    "- `--from=builder`: Copy from named stage\n",
    "- Only copies installed packages, not build tools\n",
    "- `ENV PATH`: Makes copied executables findable\n",
    "\n",
    "### The --user Flag Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without --user**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install torch  # Installs to /usr/local/lib/python3.10/...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scattered across system directories, hard to copy cleanly\n",
    "\n",
    "**With --user**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --user torch  # Installs to /root/.local/\n",
    "```\n",
    "Everything in one directory:\n",
    "- /root/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/\n",
    "- /root/.local/bin/\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to copy in one COPY command\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why PATH Update Is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "After copying /root/.local:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**:\n",
    "- Executables like `torch-config` are in /root/.local/bin\n",
    "- Without PATH update, they won't be found\n",
    "- System will error with \"command not found\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Multi-Stage Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple builders**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM node:18 as frontend-builder\n",
    "RUN npm install && npm run build\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM python:3.10 as backend-builder\n",
    "RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-slim\n",
    "COPY --from=frontend-builder /app/dist /app/static\n",
    "COPY --from=backend-builder /root/.local /root/.local\n",
    "```\n",
    "Combine artifacts from multiple build stages\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compile from source**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10 as builder\n",
    "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential\n",
    "RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir=/wheels torch\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-slim\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /wheels /wheels\n",
    "RUN pip install --no-cache /wheels/*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Use slim/alpine for final stage**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.10         # Builder: 900MB\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-slim    # Runtime: 120MB ✅\n",
    "FROM python:3.10-alpine  # Runtime: 50MB (but compatibility issues)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Order matters**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Copy dependencies first (changes less often)\n",
    "COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local\n",
    "# Copy code last (changes frequently)\n",
    "COPY app.py .\n",
    "```\n",
    "Better layer caching = faster rebuilds\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Clean up in builder**:\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && \\\n",
    "    rm -rf /root/.cache\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Security**:\n",
    "- Fewer packages in final image = smaller attack surface\n",
    "- No compilers/build tools in production\n",
    "- Scan images: `docker scan myimage`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Company example**:\n",
    "- Before: 8GB image, 5 min deploy time\n",
    "- After multi-stage: 2GB image, 1 min deploy time\n",
    "- Savings: $1000s/month in bandwidth and storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research example**:\n",
    "- Sharing 10GB images on slow university networks: hours\n",
    "- 2GB images: minutes\n",
    "- Reproducibility improved (people actually download and test)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare sizes**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker images | grep pytorch\n",
    "pytorch-single    latest   6.2GB\n",
    "pytorch-multi     latest   2.1GB  # 65% smaller\\!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verify it works**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --rm pytorch-multi python -c \"import torch; print(torch.__version__)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a multi-stage Dockerfile:\n",
    "1. **Stage 1 (builder)**: Use full Python 3.10, install packages with --user\n",
    "2. **Stage 2 (runtime)**: Use Python 3.10-slim, copy only installed packages\n",
    "3. Update PATH so executables are found\n",
    "4. Copy application code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success**: Image is significantly smaller but functionally identical."

    "ENV/\n",
    "env/\n",

    "**Git files** (GBs):\n",
    "```\n",
    ".git\n",
    ".gitignore\n",
    ".gitattributes\n",
    "```\n",
    "Git history not needed in container\n",

    ".vscode/\n",
    ".idea/\n",
    "*.swp\n",
    "*.swo\n",
    ".DS_Store\n",
    "```\n",
    "Editor-specific, not needed for running code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter notebooks** (optional):\n",
    "```\n",
    "*.ipynb\n",
    ".ipynb_checkpoints\n",
    "```\n",
    "Usually for development, not deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing files**:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".pytest_cache\n",
    ".coverage\n",
    "htmlcov/\n",
    ".tox/\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Whitelisting Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ignore everything except specific files**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Ignore everything\n",
    "*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Except these\n",
    "\\!app.py\n",
    "\\!requirements.txt\n",
    "\\!src/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful for monorepos where you only need subset of files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Cases for ML Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large datasets** (DON'T include in image):\n",
    "```\n",
    "data/\n",
    "datasets/\n",
    "*.csv\n",
    "*.parquet\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why**: GBs of data → huge images\n",
    "**Instead**: Mount as volume or download at runtime\n",

    "**Model checkpoints** (usually don't include):\n",
    "```\n",
    "*.pt\n",
    "*.pth\n",
    "*.ckpt\n",
    "*.safetensors\n",
    "models/\n",
    "checkpoints/\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why**: Models are GBs, change frequently\n",
    "**Instead**: Mount volume or download from model registry\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception**: Small models (<100MB) for inference containers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logs** (never include):\n",
    "```\n",
    "*.log\n",
    "logs/\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why**: Container logs should go to stdout/stderr\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check what's being sent**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build --no-cache . 2>&1 | grep 'Sending build context'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before .dockerignore**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sending build context to Docker daemon  8.5GB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After .dockerignore**:\n",

    "Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.1MB  # 4000x smaller\\!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**List files in build context**:\n",

    "docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/check alpine sh -c 'cd /check && du -sh * | sort -h'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. .dockerignore in wrong location**:\n",
    "- Must be in build context root\n",
    "- If `docker build path/to/project`, put it in `path/to/project/.dockerignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Ignoring required files**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "*.py  # Oops\\! Ignores all Python files\n",
    "```\n",
    "Build succeeds but image is broken\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Not testing .dockerignore**:\n",
    "- Always rebuild after adding .dockerignore\n",
    "- Verify image still works\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Overusing wildcards**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "*test*  # Ignores testing/ but also pytest.py\\!\n",
    "```\n",
    "Be specific\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Start with comprehensive .dockerignore**:\n",
    "- Copy from this exercise\n",
    "- Adapt to your project\n",
    "- Keep it in version control\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Regular audits**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker history myimage  # See what layers contain\n",
    "dive myimage            # Explore image layers (tool)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. CI/CD checks**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Fail if build context > 100MB\n",
    "SIZE=$(docker build . 2>&1 | grep 'Sending' | awk '{print $5}')\n",
    "if [ $SIZE -gt 100 ]; then\n",
    "  echo 'Build context too large\\!'\n",
    "  exit 1\n",
    "fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Security**:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".env         # Don't copy secrets\n",
    "*.key\n",
    "*.pem\n",
    "credentials/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Startup example**:\n",
    "- Before: 10GB context, 15 min builds\n",
    "- After .dockerignore: 5MB context, 2 min builds\n",
    "- CI/CD pipeline: 85% faster\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research lab**:\n",
    "- Accidentally included 50GB dataset\n",
    "- Docker build OOM on CI server\n",
    "- .dockerignore fixed it immediately\n",
